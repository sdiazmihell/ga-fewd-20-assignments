## Week 6 Assignment
## Intro to JavaScript
## Fun Geometry

### Intro

This assignment is primarily intended to test your knowledge of
some basic JavaScript functionality, but is also intended
to give you some practice on other CSS/HTML concepts such as floating,
positioning, transforms, gradients, and borders.

Be sure that you leave yourself plenty of time to work on the JavaScript
aspect of this assignment, since that is the primary focus of this week.


### Specs

First, you should open the file `index.html` in Chrome web browser.  You will
see 4 boxes.  You will see some dynamic behaviour if you click on each of those
boxes.  You will want to try to mimic that behavious using JavaScript.  If you
wish to add additional behaviours, you can always do that as well.


### Completed Files

Be sure to put all of your completed work in the `completed` directory
for this assignment.


### Instructions

It is ok to look at the solution files for this.  But, you should first
see if you can reference the slides and the lab files for hints.

Here are some key components of this assignment:

1. Handling JavaScript Click Events

2. Positioning

3. Floating

4. Gradients

5. Transform/Rotate


### Solutions

If you need assistance on this, you can always look at the solution code in the `solution`.
Keep in mind that the solution has only been tested on Chrome.  So, it is not guaranteed to
work in Safari and FireFox.

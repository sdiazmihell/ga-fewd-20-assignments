# BoxSteps Demo And Practice


## STAGE 1

First open this file in the browser.  You will see a simple
layout of a red box inside of a black box.


## STAGE 2

Follow along with the teacher as you:

1. Move the outer black
   box to the middle/center of the document.

2. Move the inner red box to various locations within
   the outer black box.

3. Move the inner red box outside the boundries of
   the outer black box.


## STAGE 3

On your own, during lab time, do the following:

1. Open up the file `specs/boxsteps.png`.  Your objective is to
   finish the code to make it look like the layout in that image.
   Here are the detailed instructions:

    1. Make 3 additional colored boxes.  This should give a total of 4 boxes.

    2. The 4 boxes should have the text of the numbers 1 - 4.

    3. Each box should have the following colors:

        1. Box 1 = red

        2. Box 2 = green

        3. Box 3 = blue

        4. Box 4 = yellow

    4. All 4 boxes should be aligned in a downward diagonal pattern begginning
       at the top-left and sloping down to the bottom-right of the outer black box.

2. Make your changes directly in this file and in the corresponding CSS file.

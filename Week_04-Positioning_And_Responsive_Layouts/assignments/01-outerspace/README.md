## Week 4 Assignment
## Positioning, Gradients, and Transforms
## Planets

### Intro

This assignment will test your knowledge of
CSS positioning, gradients, and transforms.

If you are getting to this assignment before the Week 4 lesson, that means
that you have not yet been taught all of the necessary skills which are
relevant to this assignment.  So, if you want a good challenge, or you just
want to get a headstart for the Week 4 class, this assignment will be a good
place to start for you.


### About

This assignment should provide a sneak peak into some of the interesting possibilities
of CSS for building more rich visually enhanced interfaces.  Some of these skills
can be relevant for 3d interfaces, gaming interfaces, and other non-standard
interface elements.  Hopefully, this will be an excited change from the usual
text and rectangle layouts that we have been working on so far.


### Specs

First, you will want to look at the `specs/planets.png` file.  The goal of this
assignment is to create a webpage which looks like this image.


### Completed Files

Be sure to put all of your completed work in the `completed` directory
for this assignment.


### Instructions

Before immediately looking at the solution files, see how far you can get
in this exercise.  With enough trial and error, it is solvable.  You should
have by now learned how to use Google for searching new concepts.

There are a few key concepts being used in this assignment:

1. Absolute Positioning

   This is the 1st piece that you should be focused on.  Start by simply
   trying to get all the components in the right place on the page.
   Try searching Google for "CSS Absolute Position".

2. Border Radius

   This is the 2nd piece that you should be focused on.  The goal of this
   will be to try to convert your rectangular elements into circles.
   Try searching Google for "CSS Border Radius Circle".

3. Gradients

   This is the 3rd piece that you should be focused on .  The goal of this
   is to create gradients that give your circles the appearance of a 3d
   sphere.

   Try searching Google for "CSS Gradient".

4. Transforms

   This is the 4th piece that you should be focused on.  The goal of this
   is to allow you to create the vertical tilted axis of the Sun (The sphere in the center)

   Try searching Google for "CSS Transform".


### Solutions

If you need assistance on this, you can always look at the solution in `solution/index.html`.
Keep in mind that the solution has only been tested on Chrome.  So, it is not guaranteed to
work in Safari and FireFox.


### Conclusion

If you are unable to finish this assignment right now, do not be discouraged.
We will be learning all the necessary pre-requisite skills for this assignment
at the next lesson (Week 4).

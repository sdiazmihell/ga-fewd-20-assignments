## Chocolate Cookie Recipe Styling

### Task

You will recall the cookie recipe from our last lesson.  We turned that recipe into HTML.
Now, you should add CSS styles to make the HTML look more like an interesting web page.
Do not worry for now about making it look fancy or visually pleasing.  Just have fun with it.
As a bonus, you should alsotry to add some new types of CSS properties that may have not been covered
in the lesson.

Some other CSS properties to try are:

* color
* background-color
* border-width
* border-color
* border-style
* font-weight
* font-style

If you need more information, you should google these properties, just as you would in the workplace.


### Details

You can use the starter code in [starter_code/index.html](starter_code/index.html) and
[starter_code/styles.css](starter_code/styles.css) to do your work.
If you want to peak at a solution you can look at [solution/index.html](solution/index.html)
and [solution/styles.css](solution/styles.css).

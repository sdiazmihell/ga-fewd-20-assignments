  Lab: Display/InlineAndBlock

  1. In the CSS file for this lab, try experimenting with the following
     css properties:

     * `width`
     * `margin`

     Were you able to notice a difference in behaviour
     between the inline and the block elements?

  2. Also see if you can change the display type for an element.
     For example, see if you can change an inline element to a block
     element, or if you can change a block element to an inline element.

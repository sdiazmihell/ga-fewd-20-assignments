  Lab: Selectors/Attribute

  In this lab, you will be using this file to practice and demonstrate
  use of CSS Attribute selectors.

  For practicing, do this:

  1. Add some elements to your HTML.  A good one to start with would be `<img>`.
     Make sure that these elements have HTML attributes.  For exampole, the `<img>`
     tag has the `alt` attribute.  Another example is that the `<a>` tag has the
     `href` attribute.
  2. In your CSS, add some CSS rules that only apply to elements having certain
     attributes and attribuyte values.
  3. Test your changes in the browser.  You can make changes directly in the dev tools
     for quick testing.

  Lab: Selectors/ChildCombinator

  In this lab, you will be using this file to practice and demonstrate
  use of CSS Child Combinators.

  For practicing, do this:

  1. Add some elements to your HTML. Make sure to add multiple nested elements.
  2. In your CSS, add some CSS rules that apply to certain child elements.  You should also
     mix in some descendant combinator examples as well.
  3. Test your changes in the browser.  You can make changes directly in the dev tools
     for quick testing.

  Lab: Selectors/DescendantCombinator

  In this lab, you will be using this file to practice and demonstrate
  use of CSS Descendant Combinators.

  For practicing, do this:

  1. Add some elements to your HTML. Make sure to add multiple nested elements.
  2. In your CSS, add some CSS rules that only apply to certain descendant elements.
  3. Test your changes in the browser.  You can make changes directly in the dev tools
     for quick testing.

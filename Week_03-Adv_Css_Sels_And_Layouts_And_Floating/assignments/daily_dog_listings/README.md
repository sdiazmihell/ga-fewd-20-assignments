## Week 2 : Assignment 2 : CSS Positioning and Layout


### About

This homework assignment is an optional assignbment if you wish to dive into
some more advanced CSS concepts.  This covers basic layout concepts.

Some of these concepts have not been thoroughly covered in class yet, so you may need to do some
of your own researh.


### Core Concepts

This is mainly a preliminary exercise in using the css `float` properties for layout purposes.
Some other properties that you will need to use include `width`, `height`, and `clear`.

You may need to use your Google skills for researching those properties.

This assignment could be somewhat difficult.  So, if you are unable to complete it,
do not be discouraged.  This is simply an exercise meant to stretch your ability
to think creatively and exercise the tenacity which is many times required for
building CSS layouts.


### Requirements

You will find an image at `specs/daily-dog-listings.png`.  Your goal here is to make
a webpage that matches the layout of that image.

You should use your own heading text, paragraph text, and images.  You do not need
to make it a webpage about "Daily Dog Listings".  You can choose whatever topic you
wish.

Take note of some of the following important sections:


#### Header

A relatively simple header.  Include border.

#### 1st 2-column section

This is a 2 column section with image on left, and text on right.  text is left aligned.
Include border.

#### 2nd 2-column section

This is a 2 column section with image on right, and text on left.  text is right aligned.
Include border.

#### Navigational footer

This footer contains a button on the leftmost side, a button on the rightmost side,
and a button in the center.  These buttons can be links or buttons.  They do not necessarily
need to link to anywhere or perform an action, but they can if you wish.  Include border.


### Notes

* When you are using `float` on elements, you will usually need to have an element below your
  floated elements with a `clear` property on it, in order to prevent other elements from
  being affected by the float.
* It is usually necesessary to set a `width` on floated elements.



### Logistics

* The solution is located in the `solution` directory, where you can see the html, css, and images.
* Place your completed code in the `completed` directory of this assignment.
* Always calidate your HTML with the html validator.

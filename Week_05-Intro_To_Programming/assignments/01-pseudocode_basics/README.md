# FEWD Week 5 Homework Assignment 1


## Instructions

1. Open the file `problems.md` on GitHub or in a Markdown viewer/editor

2. Open the empty file `completed/answers.txt`

3. You will see a number of problems, each one labeled "Problem XX" where "XX"
   is a number.  For each problem, solve the problem, and write the answer in
   the file `completed/answers.txt`.  Be sure to label each answer with the
   corresponding problem number.

4. Notify teacher on Slack when you are finished.


## Misc Info

I do not expect you to be able to successfully finish all problems,
but if you do, I will be very pleasantly surprised, as some of these
are even more advanced for many experienced programmers.

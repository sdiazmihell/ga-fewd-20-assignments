# Lab Assignment

## Chocolate Cookie Recipe Styling

### Task

Let's revisit our cookie recipe again.
Now, you should add CSS styles to make the HTML look more like an interesting web page.

Some good CSS properties to try are:

* color
* background-color
* border-width
* border-color
* border-style
* font-weight
* font-style

Also, add IDs and classes, and add CSS rules to make use of those new IDs and classes.

If you want to make the page more visibly pleasing, you can do so.  Or, you can just experiment
with various CSS features and have fun with it.

As a bonus, you should also try to add some new types of CSS properties that may have not been covered
in the lesson.  If you really want to get adventurous, see if you can use some of these:

* margin
* padding
* float, clear
* background-image
* background-attachment
* position

If you need more information, you should google these properties, just as you would in the workplace.


### Details

You can use the starter code in [starter_code/index.html](starter_code/index.html) and
[starter_code/styles.css](starter_code/styles.css) to do your work.

# Homework Assignments
## Week 7

### About

Here are your assignments for this week:

1. By now, you should have decided on a final project.  If you have not done so,
   make sure you have.
2. Finish your wireframes and requirements for your final project.
3. Spend some time on the initial HTML for your final project.  You do not need
   to finish it.
4. Try to finish the `01-calculator` homework assignment.
5. Begin to study and attempt to work on the `02-todo_list` homework assignment.
6. Read through the relevant chapters on HTML Forms and jQuery basics in your
   books "HTML & CSS" and "JavaScript & jQuery".  These books will be helpful
   to you in remembering this content.

The above items should require about 2 - 3 hours per day of your time.  As we approach
the end of the class, the amount of time you will need to invest at home will be
increasing.  If you do not do the homeworks, do not expect to be successfull in this class.

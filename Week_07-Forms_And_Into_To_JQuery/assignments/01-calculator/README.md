# Assignment
## Calculator

### Instructions

Open up the file `solution/index.html` file in your browser.  The goal here is
to make a calculator that looks and acts the same way.


### Notes

* You will use the `.val()` method to get the values of form input elements.
* Keep in mind that you will need to convert the values from strings to
  numbers.  You can do this using `parseFloat()`.
* You will probably need to look at the solution.  That is ok.

---

* If you have not been doing the homework, do not expect to be successful
  in this class, and do not expect to remember any of the material.  You
  have been warned.

---

* Although I try to, I am not always able to grade everyone's homework
  every week.  However, if you did put a lot of time into the homework,
  and specifically would like feedback on it, please let me know, and I will
  be sure to provide feedback.

---

* You should be doing about 2 - 3 hours a night of the following:
    * Reviewing the slides
    * Doing the homework
    * Reading the books I recommended
    * Working on your final project

---

* The recommended books can be found here:
  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118907442/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118907442/)
* If you have not purchased the books, please do so now

---

* By now, you need to know what your final project is.
* Make it something that you think is fun, and possibly useful.
* Don't spend too much time worrying about what your idea will be.
  The most important is that you execute on your idea.  The idea itself
  is less important.
